KISS

KISS, an acronym for **keep it simple, stupid**, is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. 
The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, 
simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
